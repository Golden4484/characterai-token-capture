## Overview

Character.AI currently does not provide a public API, which complicates obtaining authentication tokens required for unofficial integrations and tools. This repository offers a userscript solution that simplifies token capture by intercepting network requests triggered when activating the Voice Enabled Mode in chats.

## Installation and Usage (Desktop)

### Step 1: Install ViolentMonkey Extension

Install the ViolentMonkey browser extension for Chrome or Edge:

- [ViolentMonkey on Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag)

### Step 2: Install the Token Capture Userscript

Install the userscript via ViolentMonkey by visiting:

- [Character Token Capture Script on GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/545327-character-token)

### Step 3: Capture Your Authentication Token

1. Open [Character.AI](https://character.ai) and log in to your account.  
2. Start a chat with any AI character.  
3. Click the **"Activate Voice Enabled Mode"** button located beside the chatâ€™s settings ("...") menu.  
4. A modal window will appear displaying your authentication token. Copy this token for use in integrations or tools.  
5. To capture the token again, refresh the page and repeat the process.
